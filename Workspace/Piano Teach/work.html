        <p>
            <b>Traditional Suzuki</b> method, devised by its pioneer advocate, Shinichi Suzuki, applied originally to violin
            instruction.<br> Students as young as 2 or 3 learned to play their instruments in the way language was acquired,<br>
            through imitation.</p>
         <p>
             <b>Traditional Method</b> emphasizes reading music from the very beginning.  The first piano lesson, therefore, must wait until a child <br>can comprehend symbols in general.</b>

<p>On this website you’ll find information that is informative, encouraging and, maybe a little inspirational.<br>  As the site is primarily for parents who are considering a piano teacher for their child and adults who are interested, it’s a way of<br> introducing myself to you.</p>

<p>I am committed to the study of piano and the development of excellence in my students. <br> I hold a lot of respect for parents who agree to play a central role in their child’s musical<br> training, which is at the core of the Suzuki Method.</p>

<p>Studies confirm that musical training adds greatly to a child’s overall development,<br> beyond just learning to play a musical instrument.  Parents will be gratified to discover how many areas of their child’s<br> life this discipline impacts.
